				<h3>About Railblade</h3>
				<p>Railblade is just a man, whose aim is to bring entertainment and discovery to the masses through video games, music, social commentary, and anything else that happens to cross his mind. Railblade made his YouTube debut in February 2012, while still in high school, and has continued growing as a creator over the years. Railblade's YouTube career has showcased the FortressCraft VLOG series (2012-14), the FortressCraft World Tour series (2018), music made by himself and other reputable indie musicians, and other sketches, shorts, and shitposts that simply needed to be made.</p>
				<p>These days, Railblade spends the majority of his time chasing that dollar, building up to move out on his own, where he can maintain his own creativity-focused, pressure-free paradise.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>About the ezmuze mission</h3>
				<p>After the fallout of the original ezmuze central website run by the programs' creator Mad Ninja Skillz, Railblade began a mission to showcase the music made with the ezmuze+ Hamst3r edition and 2.0 programs, as well as any music made on other platforms by these ezmuze musicians.</p>
				<p>In 2015, Railblade began an initiative to assist any musician using the ezmuze+ Hamst3r edition and 2.0 programs in recording their music for them and hosting them on his website and YouTube channel, while also providing them with .MP3 copies of their music. It was Railblade's belief that the ezmuze community should stay strong and support one another, and not lay waste to the works of art they had once created.</p>
				<p>With the return of Mad Ninja Skillz and subsequent resurrection of the ezmuze website in 2018, and the creation of 'The Vault' (a collection of all tracks uploaded to the old ezmuze central site), Railblade has redirected his focus within the ezmuze community, creating and maintaining the public Discord server for the game.</p>
				<p>Throughout 2019, Railblade served as the Lead Test Engineer to Mad Ninja Skillz, collaborating to release ezmuze 3.0 for PC. More details on ezmuze 3.0 can be found on the main <a href="https://www.ezmuze.co.uk">ezmuze website</a>.</p>
